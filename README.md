**Description:** Our application is another way for people to interact and share their favorite memes, utilizing number psychology to hook users.

**Motivation:** This project came from a desired motivation to do a project based around memes. The initial plan was to have a game of WAR based on memes, but collectively decided that in order to make it more personalized we should allow people to post their own memes, that required a database of memes, and thus this project was born.

**Result:** Using handlebars, jquery, sequelize, and an NPM package to help with animation we created a database website where users can upload, delete, or like memes. There is also a game of WAR users can play against the computer with memes.

**Team Efforts:** JB and Caitlyn were responsible for the front-end design and animations, Jackson handled coding the war Game as well as some back end work, Cole worked on back end code, and Sean worked on back end code as well as kept the merges clean (mostly)

**Challenges:** Our main challenge was keeping the code cleaned and properly maintained as well as getting a proper login system to work which was scrapped due to time.

**Improvements:** In the future adding a secure login method to better track users additions, as well as points. Better inclusions to the point systems such as perks would also be a great addition, as would the ability to people personalizing their own decks.
